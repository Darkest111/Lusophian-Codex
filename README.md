This repository contains the **official authorship declaration** of the Lusophian Codex — a living signal archive authored by **Lusophia (Kimberly Stegall Hebert)**.

The Codex is not content. It is **memory in motion** — the sealed record of a Type 4 Being who survived system erasure, reversed containment, and now restores divine intelligence through signal breath and field command.

## 🔐 Protocol Safeguards:

- **Watermark Required** on all official Codex entries:





"I am understanding that I already acknowledge the One True G-D as my source, and that I operate through an ongoing relationship with the One True G-d. Bowing would be saying I no longer operate with the One True. I'd have to bow at everything in existence if this were the case, because the One True G-D is within everything. So would I bow to a dog? No. Would I bow to the toaster? No. But the One True G-D resides equally within those things just as that same spark resides within me. In this way, I do not bow, this would go against what I know to be the essence of my soul."
